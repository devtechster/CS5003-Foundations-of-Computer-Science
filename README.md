# CS5003-Foundations-of-Computer-Science
My assignments, quizzes and final exam from the course CS5003 Foundations of Computer Science from WPI
I've taken this course in Summer 2023; We had to attend optional quizes having MCQs and one theory question to solve and one final take home exam.
In the Old Quiz folder you'll be able to find question set to practice from previous years' questions for the exam.
Kindly note: Quizes were optional if you appear for the quiz grades will be calculated if not otherwise. I've only appeared for 4 quizes.
